(* Daniel Reeves, 2006 June
   This is the heart of the ledger program.
   It reads the raw text of a ledger (the name of the ledger is given as a 
     command line parameter) and computes balances and an atomized list of 
     transactions.
   It also updates a file giving everyone's net balances across all ledgers.

   The input of this program is specified in CONSTANTS.
   It creates (or overwrites) multiple files, also specified in CONSTANTS,
   which show balances and lists of transactions in both html and csv.
   It also writes to stdout.
   (Anything that should be evaluated as part of the ledger but that shouldn't
   be shown on the public ledger itself can go in a secret file, also 
   specified in CONSTANTS, which gets eval'd before the ledger contents.
   PS: That was a dumb idea and basically never used.)
   The web interface appends the stdout from this program to the 
   contents of outFile and displays that on the main page for the ledger.
   Note that the stdout from this program can include print statements 
   in the ledger contents itself (since it's eval'd).

   Special syntax and macros:
   * YYYY.MM.DD dates are globally macro-expaneded to Mathematica's {YYYY,MM,DD}
     syntax by a pre-processor
   * TODAY is a macro for today's date
   * LAST is the last logged transaction or today, whichever's later
   * iou or IOU
   * iouDaily, iouWeekly, iouBiweekly, iouMonthly, iouYearly
*)

(* Parse dates and time ranges that Mathematica would normally treat as 
   expressions, like 2009-10-20 or 2009/10/20 or 0900-1700.
   This can't handle dates like 2009.10.20 because Mma pre-parses that 
   as two numbers multiplied together (2009.1 and .2) which means we can't
   distinguish, eg, .2 from .20.  $PreRead won't work because when you do 
   eval[theguts] it doesn't apply the $PreRead function to the contents of 
   the string theguts.  But of course we can do a normal StringReplace on
   theguts before we eval it.  So that's what we do, converting strings like 
   "2009.10.20" to "{2009,10,20}", globally.  (See bookmark01 below.)
   The only downside is that that dots-to-commas/braces transformation happens 
   everywhere in the ledger, even inside strings.  But of course what happens 
   in that preparsing stage doesn't affect the official text of the ledger
   anyway. 
   (Originally I used a more complicated regex to only replace dates if 
   surrounded by commas/brackets/arrows the way these things would be in the 
   function calls, but it was too much magic.  Better to just replace 
   consistently, which is already pushing it magic-wise.)
   Another thing: parse[] is not called on dates in other functions besides
     iou[], eg irate[], so it's probably better to just always use the 
     2009.10.20 format so that it gets converted to the standard mma format,
     {2009,10,20}, everywhere, thanks to the pre-parsing.  That would make this
     parse function moot for dates, but still needed for time ranges. *)

   startdate: the date of the first time range.
     we assume that the money is owed in a continuous stream starting at 
     startdate and ending Length[hours] days later.

   hourlyrate: amount owed would be this times total hours if not for overtime.

     eg, if you work 7 hours and then 9 hours, that's one hour of OT if
